# Film Project
<pre>
I have developed an Object Oriented project in accordance with conforms to ES6 standards with class and constructor structure. My Project consists of inputs containing the name of the movie, its director and the poster link of the movie. 
As a result of entering these inputs, an object is formed and this object was prepared to include the movie name, director and poster, and in this way, I practiced creating an Object Oriented design.
